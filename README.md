How does the gender pay gap affect worker's job satisfaction?

Datasets:
1. UK Gender pay gap means in 2015 from the Office of National Statistics
    Annual gender pay gap estimates for UK employees by age, occupation, industry, full-time and part-time, region and other       geographies, and public and private sector. Compiled from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.
 In the dataset provided by the Office for National Statistics in the UK, the data is color coded in terms of its quality. 
 By importing the data, I gave a number to each color. 
 Legend: 1: Estimates are considered good quality; 2: Estimates are considered reasonable quality;
         3: Estimates are considered lower quality ; 4: x = Estimates are considered unreliable for practical purposes or are unavailable
 • If the CV values of both the male and female earnings estimates are less than or equal to 5% then the GPG estimate is considered good quality.
 • If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 5% and less than or equal to 10% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 10%) then the GPG estimate is considered reasonable quality.
 • If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 10% and less than or equal to 20% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 20%) then the GPG estimate is considered lower quality and should be used with caution.
 • If the CV value of at least one of the earnings estimates is greater than 20% then the GPG estimate is considered unreliable for practical purposes and is suppressed.                                                                         

3. UK Glassdoor reviews in 2015 from Kaggle
   This large dataset contains job descriptions and rankings among various criteria such as work-life balance, income, 
   culture, etc. The data covers the various industry in the UK. Great dataset for multidimensional sentiment analysis.
